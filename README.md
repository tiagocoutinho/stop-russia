# Stop russia

The public news that is presented in the Russian federation is all fake and we
believe that it's better to shut it down! If you want to help take the fake
news down and join the digital protest, please open this site on your devices
in the background and just let it idle. This site works by making a lot of
requests to the sites specified below in the stats section, thus overloading
them and posing a huge load on their infrastructure.

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run with:

```bash
python stop_russia.py
```
